# Age Calculator App | Frontend Mentor Project

## Project Overview:
This repository contains my solution for the Age Calculator App challenge from Frontend Mentor. The challenge was to build an age calculator that allows users to input their birthdate and see their age in years, months, and days.

## About the Age Calculator:
The Age Calculator is a simple web application that calculates a user's age based on their input birthdate. It provides the user with their age in years, months, and days..

## Error Handling:
The following errors may occur when using the Age Calculator:

This field is required: This error message appears when the user leaves the birthdate field empty.
Must be a valid date or month: This error message appears when the user enters an invalid date or month format.
Must be in the past: This error message appears when the user enters a future date as their birthdate.
